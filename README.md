SearchController with Map

I practice SearchController and display search result follow this article:
https://www.thorntech.com/2016/01/how-to-search-for-location-using-apples-mapkit/

and I update the code to Swift 3.0

Also make some style of mine:
1. Clear background toolbar.
2. remove some code I don't need.
